<p><a href="http://www.billthelizard.com/">Bill the lizard</a> has an 
<a href="http://www.billthelizard.com/2017/02/best-poker-hand.html">excellent post</a> describing an interesting puzzle as to the most desirable full house in a game of poker. The rest of this post depends upon you having read that puzzle so you may wish to do that now, or skip this post.</p>
<p>I think this represents an instance where the mathematically correct answer is not correct for other concerns. To be clear, I think the given answer is the mathematically correct answer, and the blog post linked above never suggested to answer anything other than that. In addition, there isn't really any action you can take regardless of which full house you think is better to have, the difference in the odds is small enough not to have any real-world applicability.</p>
<p>To summarise the result above, the idea is that the a full house of three aces over two kings is not as good a hand to have as a full house of three aces over two sixes. This is restricted to a game of five card draw with no wild cards etc. This is because although the AK full house is ranked higher than a full house of A6, they cannot both occur in the same hand. So to decide which you would rather have you have to look at how many possible hands can beat you. Both hands can be beaten by four-of-a-kind or a straight-flush. Because the two sixes break up more possible straight-flushes than the two kings in theory having the A6 full-house will win more hands than the AK full-house and is therefore a better hand to have.</p>
<p>However, this assumes that all straight-flushes are as likely, but this is five-card draw. Two things make a high straight-flush more likely after the draw than a low straight-flush. Firstly, someone with low cards that may make up part of a low straight-flush after the draw, may be bet out of the hand before the draw takes place. Secondly, players are more likely to hold on to higher valued cards going into the draw.</p>
<p>For example, suppose three players against you are dealt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kh, Qh, 8d, 5s, 4s</li>
<li>10d, 9s, 5h, 4h, 2d</li>
<li>Qs, Qc, 5c, 4c, 3c</li>
</ul>
<p>The first player here has two possible ways of drawing to make a straight-flush, but, if they make it to the draw, they will almost certainly retain the king and queen of hearts and not the 5 and 4 of spades. The second player has just as much chance of making a straight-flush that might beat your full-house, but chances are they won't make it to the draw. The third player actually has a better chance of making a straight-flush but there is a good chance they hold on to the pair of queens. An analogous player with a pair of 3s and J-Q-K of diamonds is a bit more likely to throw away their pair (than a player with a pair of queens) and thus stick around with a chance of beating your full-house with a straight-flush.</p>
<p>So which full-house is the better one to have is dependent upon what you think the odds are of players remaining in the hand with a possibility of a high straight-flush against the probability of a player remaining in the hand with a possibility of a low straight-flush. That isn't something that can be numerically calculated (at least not easily, you might be able to assume perfectly rational players that both do whatever gives them the highest probability of winning and assume others do the same).</p>

<p>Developing a small web application I recently had reason to upgrade from Python 3.4 to Python 3.6. The reason for the upgrade was regarding ordering of keyword arguments and not related to the bug in my test code that I then found. I should have been more careful writing my test code in the first place, so I am writing this down as some penance for not testing my tests robustly enough.</p>
<h3>A Simple example program</h3>
<p>So here I have a version of the problem reduced down to the minimum required to demonstrate the issue:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">unittest.mock</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">mock</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyClass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_method</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'__main__.MyClass'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">MockMyClass</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">MyClass</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_method</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">MockMyClass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_method</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_once</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>Of course in reality the line <code>MyClass().my_method()</code> was some test code that indirectly caused the target method to be called.</p>
<h4>Output in Python 3.4</h4>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ python3.4 mock_example.py
$
</pre>


<p>No output, leading me to believe my assertions passed, so I was happy that my code and my tests were working. As it turned out, my code was fine but my test was faulty. Here's the output in two later versions of Python of the exact same program given above.</p>
<h4>Output in Python 3.5</h4>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ python3.5 mock_example.py
Traceback <span class="o">(</span>most recent call last<span class="o">)</span>:
  File <span class="s2">"mock_example.py"</span>, line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
    MockMyClass.my_method.assert_called_once<span class="o">()</span>
  File <span class="s2">"/usr/lib/python3.5/unittest/mock.py"</span>, line 583, in __getattr__
    raise AttributeError<span class="o">(</span>name<span class="o">)</span>
AttributeError: assert_called_once
</pre>


<p>Assertion error, test failing.</p>
<h4>Output in Python 3.6</h4>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ python3.6 mock_example.py
Traceback <span class="o">(</span>most recent call last<span class="o">)</span>:
  File <span class="s2">"mock_example.py"</span>, line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
    MockMyClass.my_method.assert_called_once<span class="o">()</span>
  File <span class="s2">"/usr/lib/python3.6/unittest/mock.py"</span>, line 795, in assert_called_once
    raise AssertionError<span class="o">(</span>msg<span class="o">)</span>
AssertionError: Expected <span class="s1">'my_method'</span> to have been called once. Called <span class="m">0</span> times.
</pre>


<p>Test also failing with a different error message. Anyone who is (pretty) familiar with the <code>unittest.mock</code> standard library module will know <code>assert_called_once</code> was introduced in version 3.6, which is my version 3.5 is failing with an attribute error.</p>
<h3>My test was wrong</h3>
<p>The problem was, my original test was not testing anything at all. The 3.4 version of the <code>unittest.mock</code> standard library module did not have a <code>assert_called_once</code>. The mock, just allows you to call any method on it, to see this you can try changing the line:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>        <span class="n">MockMyClass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_method</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_once</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>to</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>        <span class="n">MockMyClass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_method</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">blahblah</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>With <code>python3.4</code>, <code>python3.5</code>, and <code>python3.6</code> this yields no error. So in the original program you can avoid the calling <code>MyClass.my_method</code> at all:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'__main__.MyClass'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">MockMyClass</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c1"># Missing call to `MyClass().my_method()`</span>
        <span class="n">MockMyClass</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_method</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_once</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># In 3.4 this still passes.</span>
</pre>


<p>This does not change the (original) results, <code>python3.4</code> still raises <strong>no error</strong>, whereas <code>python3.5</code> and <code>python3.6</code> are raising the original errors.</p>
<p>So although my code turned out to be correct (at least in as much as the desired method was called), had it been faulty (or changed to be faulty) my test would not have complained.</p>
<h3>The Actual Problem</h3>
<p>My mock was wrong. I should instead have been patching the actual method within the class, like so:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">mock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">patch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'__main__.MyClass.my_method'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">mock_my_method</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">MyClass</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">my_method</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">mock_my_method</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert_called_once</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>Now if we try this in all version 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 of python we get:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ python3.4 mock_example.py 
$ python3.5 mock_example.py 
Traceback <span class="o">(</span>most recent call last<span class="o">)</span>:
  File <span class="s2">"mock_example.py"</span>, line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
    mock_my_method.assert_called_once<span class="o">()</span>
  File <span class="s2">"/usr/lib/python3.5/unittest/mock.py"</span>, line 583, in __getattr__
    raise AttributeError<span class="o">(</span>name<span class="o">)</span>
AttributeError: assert_called_once
$ python3.6 mock_example.py 
$ 
</pre>


<p>So Python 3.4 and 3.6 pass as we expect. But Python3.5 gives an error stating that there is no <code>assert_called_once</code> method on the mock object, which is true since that method was not added until version 3.6. This is arguably what Python3.4 should have done.</p>
<p>It remains to check that the updated test fails in Python3.6, so we comment out the call to <code>MyClass().my_method</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ python3.6 mock_example.py 
Traceback <span class="o">(</span>most recent call last<span class="o">)</span>:
  File <span class="s2">"mock_example.py"</span>, line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
    mock_my_method.assert_called_once<span class="o">()</span>
  File <span class="s2">"/usr/lib/python3.6/unittest/mock.py"</span>, line 795, in assert_called_once
    raise AssertionError<span class="o">(</span>msg<span class="o">)</span>
AssertionError: Expected <span class="s1">'my_method'</span> to have been called once. Called <span class="m">0</span> times.
</pre>


<p>This is the test I <strong>should</strong> have performed with my original test. Had I done this I would have seen that the test passed in Python3.4 regardless of whether the method in question was actually called or not.</p>
<p>So now my test works in <code>python3.6</code>, fails in <code>python3.5</code> because I'm using the method <code>assert_called_once</code> which was introduced in <code>python3.6</code>. Unfortunately it incorrectly passes in <code>python3.4</code>. So if I want my code to work properly for python versions earlier than 3.6, then I can essentially implement <code>assert_called_once()</code> with <code>assert len(mock_my_method.mock_calls) == 1</code>. If we do this then my test passes in all three version of python and fails in all three if we comment out the call <code>MyClass().my_method()</code>.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>I made an error in writing my original test, but my real sin was that I was a bit lazy in that I did not make sure that my tests would fail, when the code was incorrect. In this instance there was no problem with the code only the test, but that was luck. So for me, this served as a reminder to check that your tests can fail. It may be that mutation testing would have caught this error.</p>

<p>I have written before about Flask and obtaining test coverage results
<a href="posts/flask-%2B-coverage-analysis">here</a>
and with an update
<a href="posts/update-flask%2Bcoverage">here</a>.
This is pretty trivial if you're writing unit tests that directly call the application, but if you actually want to write tests which animate a browser, for example with selenium, then it's a little more complicated, because the browser/test code has to run concurrently with the server code.</p>
<p>Previously I would have the Flask server run in a separate process and run 'coverage' over that process. This was slightly unsatisfying, partly because you sometimes want coverage analysis of your actual tests. Test suites, just like application code, can grow in size with many utility functions and imports etc. which may eventually end up not actually being used. So it is good to know that you're not needlessly maintaining some test code which is not actually invoked.</p>
<p>We could probably get around this restriction by running coverage in both the server process and the test-runner's process and combine the results (or simply view them separately). However, this was unsatisfying simply because it felt like something that should not be necessary. Today I spent a bit of time setting up the scheme to test a Flask application without the need for a separate process.</p>
<p>I solved this now, by not using Flask's included Werkzeug server and instead using the WSGI server included in the standard-library <code>wsgiref.simple_server</code> module. Here is, a minimal example:</p>

<p>To run this you will of course need <code>flask</code> as well as <code>pytest</code>, <code>pytest-cov</code>, and <code>selenium</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ pip install flask pytest pytest-cov selenium
</pre>


<p>In addition you will need the <code>phantomjs</code> to run:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ npm install phantomjs
$ <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span>:./node_modules/.bin/
</pre>


<p>Then to run it, the command is:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>$ py.test --cov<span class="o">=</span>./ app.py
$ coverage html
</pre>


<p>The <code>coverage html</code> is of course optional and only if you wish to view the results in friendly HTML format.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>I've not used this extensively myself yet, so there may be some problems when using a more interesting flask application.</p>
<p>Don't put your virtual environment directory in the same directory as <code>app.py</code> because in that case it will perform coverage analysis over the standard library and dependencies.</p>
<p>In a real application you will probably want to make a <code>pytest</code> fixture out of the server thread and browser client. So that you can use each for multiple separate test functions. Essentially your test function should just be the part inside the <code>try</code> clause.</p>
<p>I have not used the <code>log_current_page</code> method but I frequently find it quite useful so included it here nonetheless.</p>

    <div>
<p>I come from a functional programming background, so I a lot of love for functions and so-called anonymous functions or lambdas. However, I have realised that I don't make use of Python's lambda syntax much, and I wanted to articulate why. This may mostly sound pretty negative towards lambdas, but bear in mind I'm certainly not against lambdas in general.</p>
<p>A <code>lambda</code> expression could always be avoided by simply defining the function in question. So the question becomes when is a <code>lambda</code> more readable than a definition? That is almost always because the function you're attempting to create is so simple that the definition syntax gets in the way. It is often used when the function in question is going to be used as an argument to some method. For example the <code>sort</code> method on a list takes as argument they <code>key</code> to be used when comparing the elements. So if you have a list of items and you want to sort them by their prices you can do something such as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">price</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>We could of course have gotten the use of <code>lambda</code> with a definition:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">price</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">price</span>
<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">price</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>This is not <strong>quite</strong> equivalent because it introduces a new name into the current scope that would not otherwise have been there, but I don't ever recall reaching for a <code>lambda</code> expression in order to avoid polluting the name space.</p>
<p>We could even define a generic higher-order function to make a function out of attribute access.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attr_name</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">attr_getter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">attr_name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">attr_getter</span>

<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">f_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'price'</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre>


<p>This is surely worse than the first two attempts, but if you have multiple sorts to do, then using definitions can get tedious:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">price</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">price</span>
<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">price</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">quantity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">quantity</span>
<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">quantity</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">margin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">margin</span>
<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">margin</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>as compared with the lambda version:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">price</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">quantity</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">margin</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>The <code>f_attr</code> version is similar:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">f_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'price'</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">f_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'quantity'</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">f_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'margin'</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>In fact that could be done with a loop:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">attribute</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'price'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'quantity'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'margin'</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">f_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attribute</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">list_of_items</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>


<p>I think the <code>lambda</code> version is at least sometimes more readable. However, I often miss the self-documenting nature of a definition, in that giving the function a name acts as some pretty decent documentation especially for the kind of simple function you might otherwise use a <code>lambda</code> expression for.</p>
<p>So, for a <code>lambda</code> expression to be the right choice, the function in question has to be so simple as to not benefit from the extra documentation afforded by its name (such as simple attribute access). </p>
<p>I just don't seem to find myself in that situation very often. Perhaps I'm just not making my own functions general enough by accepting functions as arguments.</p>

    <div>
<p>Looking through the code of an open-source Python project I came across code that amounts to the following:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsockname</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
</pre>


<p>This looks odd because if the condition is <code>True</code> then we forget about the <code>host_name</code> derived from the call to <code>self.connection.getsockname</code>. However it could be that that call has some side-effect. Assuming that it does not we can re-write the above code as:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsockname</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<p>Or even, if you prefer:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsockname</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>


<p>Or:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsockname</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>


<p>Or finally:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsockname</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>


<p>Note that this last version has slightly different semantics in that it will use the call to <code>getsockname</code> if <code>self.server.host_name</code> is at all falsey, in particular if it is <code>''</code>.</p>
<p>I love finding minor refactoring opportunities like this. I enjoy going through code and finding such cases. I believe if a project's source code has many such opportunites it hints that the authors do not engage in routine refactoring. However, this post is more about how such a refactoring interacts with Python's `@property' decorator.</p>
<h3>The <code>@property</code> decorator</h3>
<p>In this case we call <code>getsockname</code>, so when considering our refactoring we have to be careful that there are no significant side-effects. However even if the code had been:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
</pre>


<p>We would still have to go and check the code to make sure that either <code>connection</code> or <code>host_name</code> is not implemented as <code>property</code> and if so, that they do not have significant side-effects.</p>
<p>One question arises. What to do if it <em>does</em> have significant side-effects? Leaving it as is means subsequent readers of the code are likely to go through the same thought process. The code as is, <strong>looks</strong> suspicious.</p>
<p>First off, if I could, I'd refactor <code>self.connection.host_name</code> so that it does not have side-effects, perhaps the side-effects are put into a separate method that is called in any case:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setup_host_name</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
</pre>


<p>Assuming I don't have the ability to modify <code>self.connection.host_name</code>, I could still refactor my own code to have the side-effects separately. Something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Whatever</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">setup_host_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>

    <span class="o">....</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setup_host_name</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_host_name</span>
</pre>


<p>I think that is better than the easy opt-out of a comment. Obviously in this case we have some control over the class in question since we're referencing <code>self</code>. But imagine that <code>self</code> was some <code>other</code> variable that we don't necessarily have the ability to modify the class of, then a more lightweight solution would be something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">other</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sb">`other`</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sb">`other`</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
</pre>


<p>This of course assumes that the side-effects in question are not related to <code>other.server.host_name</code>. An alternative in either case:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="n">connection_host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connection_host_name</span>
</pre>


<p>I'm not sure that either <em>really</em> conveys that <code>other.connection.host_name</code> is evaluated for its side-effects. Hence, in this case, I would opt for a comment, but you may disagree.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The <code>@property</code> decorator in Python is very powerful and I love it and use it regularly. However, we should note that it comes with the drawback that it can make code more difficult to evaluate locally.</p>
<p>A comprehensive test-suite would alay most fears of making such a minor refactor.</p>
<p>Finally, finding such code in a code-base is well worth refactoring. The odd bit of code like this is always likely to sneak in unnoticed, and can often be the result of several other simplifications. However, if you find many of these in a project's source code, I believe it is symptomatic of at least one of two things; either the authors don't engage in much refactoring or general code-maintenance, <em>or</em> there is a lack of a decent test-suite which makes such refactorings more of a chore.</p>
<h3>Final irrelevant aside</h3>
<p>In a <a href="posts/if-as-syntax-possibility">previous post</a> I made a suggestion about <code>if-as</code> syntax. I'm still against this idea, however this is the sort of situation it would (potentially) benefit. Our second syntax possibility could have been:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">host_name</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">hn</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">hn</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getsockname</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>


<p>Whilst this is shorter and reduces some repetition, it's unclear to me if this is more readable.</p>

<p>More than a decade and a half ago, <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/">Kragen Javier Sitaker</a> wrote a blog post <a href="http://canonical.org/~kragen/isinstance/">isinstance() considered harmful</a>, a lot of which I believe holds up pretty well today. It's well worth reading it in its entirety but the gist is that rather than testing a value against a specific type, you generally wish to check that a value confirms to a particular interface. Or if you prefer, using <code>isinstance</code> is imparting <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?NominativeAndStructuralTyping">nominative typing</a> in a language where duck typing is the convention.</p>
<p>I came across what I initially thought was a reasonable use of <code>isintance</code> and this post is about my attempts to remove the reliance on <code>isinstance</code>.</p>
<h3>The case</h3>
<p>Writing a web application often involves checking the contents of the current page for specific content. Usually in the form of CSS selectors, or simply text. I had written a simple method to check whether specific texts were contained in any elements matching a given CSS selector. For example, you may have some way of flashing messages and you want to check that after a given request the resulting web page contains the list of messages that you expect.</p>
<p>However, the general idea can be condensed to the more simple task of checking whether a list of texts are present with a main text. So the general idea is something like the following:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="n">test_content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"abcdefg qwerty"</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'abcdefg'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'qwerty'</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
</pre>


<p>This works fine, but this is in testing code, so we want to make sure that tests do not inadvertently pass. The problem here is that the <code>texts</code> argument is intended to be  a list, or more generally, a container of some strings. The potential problem is that it is easy enough to make the mistake of calling this method with a single string. Strings are iterable, so unfortunately the following assertion passes:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">test_content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"abcdefg qwerty"</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'gfedcba'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
</pre>


<p>This is because each of the characters in the single string argument are themselves in the main content, although the string itself is not.</p>
<p>A potential fix for this is to use <code>isinstance</code> on the argument:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">isinstance_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">texts</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">content</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="n">test_content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"abcdefg qwerty"</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">isinstance_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'abcdefg'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">isinstance_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'gfedcba'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
</pre>


<p>In this case we do the right thing if the method is called with a single string as the argument, but you could of course instead raise an error. So this basically solves our problem, but at the cost of using <code>isinstance</code>.</p>
<p>What happens if the content becomes a bytestring, and the input strings themselves are bytestrings:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">isinstance_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello world'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'world'</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">isinstance_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello world'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'olleh'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
</pre>


<p>We have the same problem as before. We could of course solve this by using <code>if isintance(texts, str) or isinstance(texts, bytes)</code>, but that feels like we're not really solving the essence of the problem.</p>
<h3>Without isinstance</h3>
<p>So instead of using <code>isinstance</code> we could check for what interface is supported by the argument. If we want to check that it is a singleton argument then we would be looking for something supported by strings and bytestrings, but not by, lists, sets, or other general containers:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">str_and_bytestring</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)]</span>

<p>Sort of success, but this feels as if we're not really writing down what we mean. We don't really care if <code>texts</code> has a <code>capitalize</code> attribute at all. What we want to avoid is <code>texts</code> being a single argument that happens to be iterable. We can check which attributes containers such as lists and sets have that strings or bytestrings do not:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">list_and_set</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">([])</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">set</span><span class="p">())]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">str_or_bytestring</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">dir</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">listy_but_not_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">list_and_set</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">str_or_bytestring</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">listy_but_not_string</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'clear'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'copy'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'pop'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'remove'</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre>


<p>So we can check if the first argument has a 'clear' attribute:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">interface_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'clear'</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">texts</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">content</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="n">test_content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"abcdefg qwerty"</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">interface_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'abcdefg'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">interface_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'gfedcba'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">interface_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello world'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'world'</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">interface_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello world'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'olleh'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
</pre>


<p>Unfortunately, you now cannot pass a generator, the following fails with a type error because <code>interface_contains_texts</code> attempts to check if the generator is in the given string.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">interface_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">test_content</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">()))</span> 
</pre>


<p>Unfortunately there is no attribute that is on a list, set, and generator that is <em>not</em> on a string or bytestring. But generators do have a <code>close</code> attribute so we could do:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">interface_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'clear'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'close'</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>


<p>This does feel close to what we want. We are saying "If the argument is not a list, set style container, or a generator, then we treat it as one singleton".</p>
<h3>All of this could be avoided</h3>
<p>Another way to do this would be to allow a variable number of arguments into the <code>contains_texts</code> function:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">texts</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="n">test_content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"abcdefg qwerty"</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'abcdefg'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'gfedcba'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'abcdefg'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'qwerty'</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello world'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'world'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'hello world'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s1">'olleh'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">test_content</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">()))</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
</pre>


<p>This works for all our cases. You do have to star the argument if you already have a list or generator:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'abcdefg'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'qwerty'</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">test_content</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">()))</span> <span class="c1"># Passes</span>
</pre>


<p>However, recall our original problem was that if you accidentally passed in a single string as the argument your test function may quietly, and erroneously, pass. However, if you forget the star to this function:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'abcdefg'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'qwerty'</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="n">Traceback</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">most</span> <span class="n">recent</span> <span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">last</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">File</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
  <span class="n">File</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">variable_args_contains_texts</span>
<span class="ne">TypeError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'in &lt;string&gt;'</span> <span class="n">requires</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">left</span> <span class="n">operand</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nb">list</span>
</pre>


<p>You get an error. That's quite alright with me, this will flag up immediately that I've written my test incorrectly and I can fix it immediately. Even if I had the original <code>contains_texts</code> and update it to this variable args version, when I re-run my test-suite it will let me know of any places I've forgotten to update the call.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Its debateable whether or not the <code>interface_contains_texts</code> version was better than the original <code>isintance_contains_texts</code> version. I prefer it because I feel it is a bit more general. I definitely prefer the eventual <code>variable_args_contains_texts</code> version. I guess that's the main conclusion for now, that checking your uses of <code>isinstance</code> may lead to a better implementation.</p>
<p>Although I was able to use variable arguments to the solve the problem in this case, there will obviously be cases where that fix does not apply. However, the main takeaway is that you don't necessarily have to swap your <code>isinstance</code> use for a <code>hasattr</code> use, thereby directly translating the use of <code>isinstance</code>. It could be that by having a slightly broader look at the general problem you're trying to solve, another solution is available.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Typically routes in a web application that require login are explicitly marked as such. Whilst routes that are open to general (anonymous) users, are left unmarked and hence implicitly do not require login. Because the default is to allow all users to visit a particular route, it is easy to forget to mark a route as requiring a login.</p>
<p>I'm going to show a small pattern for making sure that all routes in a web application are explicitly marked as either requiring login or not-requiring login. As an example this will be done in a Python, Flask-based web application using <a href="https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask-Login</a> but the general idea probably works in at least some other Python web application frameworks. </p>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>Let's start with a very simple Flask web application that just has two routes:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">flask</span>

<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flask</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">static_folder</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/unprotected'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">unprotected</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">'Hello everyone, anonymous users included!'</span>

<span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/protected'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">protected</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">'Hello users, only those of you logged-in!'</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>Now, obviously we want the <code>protected</code> route to only be available to those users who have logged in, whilst the <code>unprotected</code> route is available to all. We'll leave the details of how users actually sign-up, log-in and log-out, see the <a href="https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask-Login documentation for examples</a>.</p>
<p>To mark our <code>protected</code> route we can use the decorator provided by Flask-Login:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">flask_login</span>
<span class="o">...</span>

<span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/protected'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@flask_login.login_required</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">protected</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">'Hello users, only those of you logged-in!'</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
</pre>


<p>I only added two lines, the import of <code>flask_login</code> and a second decorator to the <code>protected</code> method. This is how Flask-Login works. You decorate those routes that you wish to be protected. As I said, this scheme is fine, but it is easy enough to forget to mark a route that should be protected.</p>
<h2>Explicitly mark all routes</h2>
<p>The scheme I used, was to make a decorator that accepted a parameter. If the parameter is <code>True</code> then all routes associated with the decorated view function are marked as requiring login. In addition, this decorator sets an attribute on the view function itself indicating whether or not login is required. We can then check <em>all</em> view functions and assert that they have the chosen attribute. So first the new view functions, with a decorator we'll add.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/unprotected'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@login_required</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">unprotected</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">'Hello everyone, anonymous users included!'</span>

<span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/protected'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nd">@login_required</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">protected</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">'Hello users, only those of you logged-in!'</span>
</pre>


<p>So fairly simple stuff. Now to create the decorator:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">login_required</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">required</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">decorator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">required</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flask_login</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">login_required</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">login_required</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">required</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">decorator</span>
</pre>


<p>This just calls the original <code>@flask_login.login_required</code> decorator in the case that the argument is <code>True</code>, but in addition adds an attribute to the view function that we can check later.</p>
<h3>Ensure all are marked</h3>
<p>So to ensure that all routes have been marked in some way you just need to check all view functions have the <code>login_required</code> attribute set:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">view_f</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">view_functions</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"{} needs to set whether login is required or not"</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">view_f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'login_required'</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">message</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<p>Now if you run this you will get such an error. That is because you don't set up all of your own routes, in particular Flask provides a <code>static</code> route. That's easy enough to ignore though:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="n">ignored_views</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'static'</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">view_f</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">view_functions</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"{} needs to set whether login is required or not"</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">ignored_views</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">view_f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'login_required'</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">message</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>


<h3>Tidy up</h3>
<p>There are just a couple of small caveats. Firstly, Flask-Login, provides a decorator to indicate that not only is login required, but it must be a <em>fresh</em> login. We can just allow passing <code>"fresh"</code> as an argument to our <code>login_required</code> decorator:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">login_required</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">required</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">decorator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">required</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'fresh'</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">flask_login</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fresh_login_required</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h3>Flask extensions</h3>
<p>Many Flask extensions provide their own routes which are mapped to view functions that they have defined. You <em>could</em> add those to the <code>ignored_views</code> list, but this seems like additional maintenance. Worse, something like <a href="https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask-Admin</a> adds a large number of view functions. In addition, if you setup Flask-Admin to automatically generate model views for each of the models in your database, then if you add to your database model it will generate <em>more</em> view functions and you will have to update your <code>ignored_views</code> list again. The alternative is to perform your <code>check_all_views_declare_login_required</code> before you call <code>init_app</code> on your <code>admin</code> instance. Suppose you have:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">flask</span>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I quite like that I now explicitly state for each route whether I require login or not, rather than relying on a default. You could of course extend this to your particular privileges scheme, for example you may have levels of authentication, such as, administrator, super-user, paid-user, normal-user, anonymous, or whatever.</p>
<p>Because the check is done whenever the module is imported, this check will also be performed when running your test-suite.</p>
<p>This won't work if your view functions are actually view methods because you won't be able to set the attribute on the view <em>method</em>. It is for exactly this reason that we had to use a list of <code>ignored_views</code> and could not just do:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>    <span class="n">static_view_function</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">view_functions</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'static'</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">static_view_function</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">login_required</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
</pre>


<p>An alternative to this scheme would be to create your own <code>route</code> decorator that takes as parameter whether login is required as well as the normal route information. Essentially combine route and login decorators.</p>

    <div>
<p>I have a small niggle that comes up in my Python programming. I'm going to describe it and propose a possible addition to the Python programming language that would mostly solve the problem. However, I have not thought through this language modification at all thoroughly so at the moment it's just a germ of an idea. It wouldn't be a major change or fix any important problem in any case, it would just solve my own personal peeve.</p>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>First of all, a brief reminder of the very useful 'property' decorator in Python.
You may have an attribute on a class which is initially a simple value. However,
at some point later you realise that you need to calculate that attribute everytime
it is accessed. You may have something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Person</span>(<span class="n">object</span>):
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__init__</span>(<span class="k">self</span>, <span class="n">gender</span>):
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">gender</span> = <span class="n">gender</span>
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">age</span> = <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre>


<p>You then realise that this means you would have to continually update the person's
age. So instead you implement <code>age</code> as a "property":</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Person</span>(<span class="n">object</span>):
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__init__</span>(<span class="k">self</span>, <span class="n">gender</span>):
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">gender</span> = <span class="n">gender</span>
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">dob</span> = <span class="n">datetime</span>.<span class="n">today</span>()

    <span class="nv">@property</span>
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">age</span>(<span class="k">self</span>):
        <span class="k">return</span> (<span class="n">datetime</span>.<span class="n">today</span>() - <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">dob</span>).<span class="n">years</span>
</pre>


<p>For the most part I like this ability and use it frequently. You may even have
two distinct classes which both implement a particular protocol, part of which
is that the object in question must have a particular attribute. It may be that
for one kind of object the attribute is indeed a simple attribute, but that for
another it must be calculated.</p>
<p>So properties are, I think, generally a good addition to the language. One
downside is that sometimes a simple attribute access, <code>my_object.my_attribute</code>
can be a more expensive operation than it looks because it is actually
implemented as a property.</p>
<h3>Peeve</h3>
<p>In Python I find myself doing something like the following quite often:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>if object.attribute:
    do_something(object.attribute)
else:
    do_something_else(object)
</pre>


<p>For example, I might be showing a user of a web application why they cannot
perform some action they are attempting to:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>if post.unpublishable_reasons:
    for reason in post.unpublishable_reasons:
        flask.flash(reason)
    return render_template('error.html', ...)
else:
    return render_template('published.html', ...)
</pre>


<p>Where <code>post.unpublishable_reasons</code> might be a property on a <code>class</code> which may
take some time to calculate:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Post</span>(<span class="n">database</span>.<span class="n">Model</span>):
    ....
    <span class="nv">@property</span>
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">unpublishable_reasons</span>(<span class="k">self</span>):
        ... <span class="n">something</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">takes</span> <span class="nb">time</span> <span class="o">and</span> <span class="n">ultimately</span> <span class="n">calculates</span> <span class="n">reasons</span>...
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">reasons</span>
</pre>


<p>Which then leads me to have code like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>reasons = post.unpublishable_reasons
if reasons:
    for reason in reasons:
        flask.flash(reason)
    return render_template('error.html', ...)
else:
    return render_template('published.html', ...)
</pre>


<p>This just irks me as a little inelegant. So I confess that I would quite like
Python to allow something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>if post.unpublishable_reasons as reasons:
    for reason in reasons:
        flask.flash(reason)
    return render_template('error.html', ...)
else:
    return render_template('published.html', ...)
</pre>


<h3>Comprehensions</h3>
<p>This might also partially solve a problem with comprehensions in that you can
filter-then-map but not map-then-filter. A filter-then-map looks like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>positive_doubles = [i * 2 for i in my_numbers if i &gt; 0]
</pre>


<p>We first filter on each number (whether it is greater than zero) then each of
those numbers which makes it through the filter is multiplied by two. It's a bit
awkward to do the opposite, which is mapping the value first and then filtering
on the result of the map. So if we wanted all the squares of a list of numbers
that are less than 100 we require to do the operation twice:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>small_squares = [i * i for i in my_numbers if (i * i) &lt; 100]
</pre>


<p>Notice we had to have <code>i * i</code> twice. It might be that the operation in question
is quite expensive, so instead we can have two comprehensions:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>small_squares = [x for x in (i * i for i in my_numbers) if x &lt; 100]
</pre>


<p><del>Of course if the list is very long this might be a bit slow because we iterate
through it twice.</del> Edit. Not true as we use a generator on the inner loop as
pointed out in the comments below.</p>
<p>Now if we allow some kind of if-as syntax we might be able to do something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>new_list = [y for x in old_list if f(x) as y]
</pre>


<p>This doesn't allow general filtering but would allow filtering out of falsey values.
I'm much less keen on this as I feel if Python were to attack the map-then-filter
problem for comprehensions then it should solve it completely.</p>
<p>In particular this would not work for the <code>small_squares</code> example, for that we
would need to allow something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>small_squares = [x for i in my_numbers if (i * i as x) &gt; 100]
</pre>


<p>Note that this is even more of an extension than that proposed. That is assigning
<code>x</code> to a particular sub-expression of the condition.</p>

<p>In many cases whilst programming there is a decision to be made as to whether
to <em>store</em> some state, or (re)<em>caluate</em> it as and when needed. Obviously every
situation is different and therefore there is no one answer which fits. In this
post I'm going to attempt to explain the distinction and the benefits/drawbacks
of either approach. I hope that just remembering that this choice exists will
force me to make an explicit choice, such that I may think about it a bit more.</p>
<h2>Distinction</h2>
<p>The distinction is a little akin to that between eager evaluation and lazy
evalution but it is not the same. The distinction here is about code-maintenance.
I'll start with a very simple example, and then move to a more realistic example
which involves access to a database, which makes the decision a bit more interesting.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a very simple <code>class</code> representing a person and the children
that they may have:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Person</span>(<span class="n">object</span>):
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__init__</span>(<span class="k">self</span>, <span class="n">gender</span>):
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">gender</span> = <span class="n">gender</span>
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">boys</span> = []
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">girls</span> = []

    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">have_baby_girl</span>(<span class="k">self</span>)
        <span class="n">girl</span> = <span class="n">Person</span>(<span class="s">'female'</span>)
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">girls</span>.<span class="n">append</span>(<span class="n">girl</span>)
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">girl</span>

    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">have_baby_boy</span>(<span class="k">self</span>):
        <span class="n">boy</span> = <span class="n">Person</span>(<span class="s">'male'</span>)
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">boys</span>.<span class="n">append</span>(<span class="n">boy</span>)
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">boy</span>
</pre>


<p>Now, suppose somewhere in your code you wish to return the number of children
that a particular person has. You can either keep track of this, or calculate it
on the fly, here is the keep-track-of-it version:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Person</span>(<span class="n">object</span>):
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">__init__</span>(<span class="k">self</span>, <span class="n">gender</span>):
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">gender</span> = <span class="n">gender</span>
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">boys</span> = []
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">girls</span> = []
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">number_of_children</span> = <span class="mi">0</span>

    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">have_baby_girl</span>(<span class="k">self</span>)
        <span class="n">girl</span> = <span class="n">Person</span>(<span class="s">'female'</span>)
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">girls</span>.<span class="n">append</span>(<span class="n">girl</span>)
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">number_of_children</span> += <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">girl</span>

    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">have_baby_boy</span>(<span class="k">self</span>):
        <span class="n">boy</span> = <span class="n">Person</span>(<span class="s">'boy'</span>)
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">boys</span>.<span class="n">append</span>(<span class="n">boy</span>)
        <span class="k">self</span>.<span class="n">number_of_children</span> += <span class="mi">1</span>

<p>In this particular case I prefer the calculate-it-on-the-fly approach. I like
that I did not have to modify any existing code, I only had to add some. If I
add some other method (suppose an <code>adopt</code> method) then in the keep-track-of-it
version I have to make sure I update our state variable <code>number_of_children</code>
appropriately. Finally, if we change our definition of what a 'child' is,
suppose they have to be under 18 years-of-age, then keeping track-of-it, might
not work at all, or if it does I have to be very careful about updating parents
whenever a child ages.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, this is often trickty to evaluate correctly. Essentially,
you're asking whether the calculation of the state on the fly, is more expensive,
than code to keep track of it. This of course depends hugely on often you inspect
the state. You may do a lot of work to keep-track of a state variable that is
never inspected, or inspected only very rarely. On the other hand, if it is
inspected often, but not updated much, the calculate-it-on-the-fly approach,
may be needlessly re-doing the exact same computation many times.</p>
<p>As a side-note there is a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lazy/1.2">lazy</a> package
for Python that lets you calculate attributes once when needed, and then stores
the result for later retrieval. Of course if you update anything the calculation
depends upon you have to make sure an invalidate the stored result. I've found
it is useful in the case that an attribute won't ever need to be re-calculated,
but might never need to be calculated at all (and is expensive to do so).</p>
<h2>More interesting example</h2>
<p>For in-memory occurrences such as the simple example above, often the choice is
pretty clear. Code is often clearer if you calculate-it-on-the-fly, and only
resort to keep-track-of-it whenever the value is somewhat expensive to calculate,
used very often, or particularly simple to keep track of.</p>
<p>However, the choice becomes more interesting when the calculation of the value
involves some external state, even if keeping-track-of-it is done on the
external state. A common case is when the state is kept in a database. In Python,
you may well be using an ORM to access the external state. </p>
<p>Consider an online game website, for some game that has four players. Let's
suppose the game is turn-based and players are not expected to be logged in for
the entire duration, but just take their turn whenever they are online. The game
then can be in multiple states: waiting for players, running, finished. So in
some ORM you might describe a game like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Game</span>(<span class="n">database</span>.<span class="n">Model</span>):
    <span class="n">player_one_id</span> = <span class="n">Column</span>(<span class="n">Integer</span>, <span class="n">ForeignKey</span>(<span class="s">'user.id'</span>))
    <span class="n">player_two_id</span> = <span class="n">Column</span>(<span class="n">Integer</span>, <span class="n">ForeignKey</span>(<span class="s">'user.id'</span>))
    <span class="n">player_three_id</span> = <span class="n">Column</span>(<span class="n">Integer</span>, <span class="n">ForeignKey</span>(<span class="s">'user.id'</span>))
    <span class="n">player_four_id</span> = <span class="n">Column</span>(<span class="n">Integer</span>, <span class="n">ForeignKey</span>(<span class="s">'user.id'</span>))

    <span class="n">winner_id</span> = <span class="n">Column</span>(<span class="n">Integer</span>, <span class="n">ForeignKey</span>(<span class="s">'user.id'</span>))

    .... <span class="n">bunch</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">other</span> <span class="n">columns</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">actually</span> <span class="n">describe</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">game</span> <span class="k">state</span> ....
</pre>


<p>Now, suppose you wish to display a list of running games for a user, you could
do it something like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">Game</span>(<span class="n">database</span>.<span class="n">Model</span>):

            )
        ).<span class="nb">all</span>()

            <span class="n">and_</span>(
                <span class="n">Game</span>.<span class="n">player_one_id</span> != <span class="n">user</span>.<span class="n">id</span>,

        ).<span class="nb">all</span>()
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">games</span>

<p>Using this way you would have to make sure that when the fourth player joins a
game the state is set to 'running', and when the game finishes the state is set
to 'finished', along with the 'winner' being set.</p>
<p>Instead one could use calculate-it-on-the-fly as in:</p>

        ).<span class="nb">all</span>()
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">games</span>
</pre>


<p>This could be simplified a bit if we assume that players fill slots in order
such that it is never the case that <code>Game.player_four_id</code> is not <code>None</code> whilst
one of the others is. </p>
<p>In this particular case then I think the keep-track-of-it is a little simpler.
But this hugely depends on the logic for joining a game, taking ones turn, and
finishing the game. In particular when a game is finished you have to set the
<code>winner_id</code> column anyway, so it seems like not too much of a burden to
additionally set the <code>state</code> column.</p>
<p>However, there are many situations in which, calculate-it-on-the-fly is more
appropriate. A common case, occurs when the rules for state changes may change.
For example, in the game case, we may decide that as long as there are two
players, people can play the game, which is therefore <code>running</code>. People may
join a <code>running</code> game, provided it is not full, and may leave a <code>running</code> game.
In this case, calculate-it-on-the-fly simply updates the rules for when a game
is <code>running</code>. However, keep-track-of-it, not only has to update its rules for
when to modify a state (including now reverting a game from <code>running</code> to
<code>waiting</code> when someone leaves a two player game), but must also go through the
database and modify the <code>state</code> column of any existing games. To do this, the
database update code will essentially have to mimic the <code>calculate-it-on-the-fly</code>
code anyway.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is often a choice to be made between maintaining some kind of state up-front,
and calculating it whenever it is required. Both are useful and should be used
depending on the situation. Recalling that there is such a choice may help a
programmer to explicitly make that choice, and perhaps even record the reasons
for it.</p>

<p>Dougal Matthews has written a <a href="http://www.dougalmatthews.com/2016/Dec/16/finding-dead-code-with-vulture/">blog post</a>
detailing how <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vulture">Vulture</a> can be used to find some dead code.
For me this was an important reminder not to rely on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/">coverage analysis</a>
to detect dead code and remove it from the your maintenance burden. More generally, whilst I adore
automated analysis tools that assist the developer in maintaining their code,
such automated analysis can give a false sense of completeness, or lead to the
developer believing that their code is "good enough". It is not a problem I have
any solution for though. The rest of the post will try to illuminate this view
point through the example of dead-code removal.</p>
<p>Dead code seems like something that should be automatically detected by tools such as both Vulture and coverage.py and
indeed many instances of dead code <em>are</em> automatically detected by such tools. However it is
worth remembering that there are instances of dead code which can never be automatically detected.</p>
<p>As a brief reminder, dead code is code that we should delete. We should delete it generally
because it either has no way of being invoked, or because we no longer require its functionality.
Because the former category has a more or less formal definition much of it can (at least in theory)
be detected automatically. The latter category is often more difficult to detect because there
are no hard rules for it. For example, you may have some code to log the state of a particular object,
and this code <strong>is</strong> invoked by production code. However, the reason for logging
the state of a particular object is no longer required. Pretty much no automated analysis can
detect this because simply writing down the rules for when such code is dead is at best non-trivial.</p>
<p>Here are some example categories of dead code along with how we might detect/track such dead code.</p>
<h3>Unused Variables</h3>
<p>If you define a variable, but then never use it, the definition is likely dead-code.</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>def my_function():
    x = assigned-expr
    # some code that never uses x
</pre>


<p>Unless the right-hand side of the definition (<code>assigned-expr</code>) has some side-effect
which is important then the assignment is dead-code and should be removed. Note here
that coverage analysis would tell you that the line is being executed.</p>
<h4>Detection</h4>
<p>As noted coverage analysis won't work here, and you would have to use something
like Vulture. Many decent IDEs will also warn you about most such circumstances.</p>
<h3>Unused Methods/Class definitions</h3>
<p>If you simple define a method or class which you never then invoke. The exception
here is if you're developing a library or otherwise exposing an interface. In this
case you should have some automated tests which should invoke the method/class.</p>
<h4>Detection</h4>
<p>Can generally be done by coverage analysis. There are however some tricky situations
which were described in the above mentioned
<a href="http://www.dougalmatthews.com/2016/Dec/16/finding-dead-code-with-vulture/">blog post</a>.
Essentially you may add a unit-test to test a particular method, which later becomes
unused by the actual application but is still invoked by the unit test.</p>
<h3>Unused Counters</h3>
<p>At one point, you may have decided to keep a count of some particular occurrence,
such as the number of guesses. Perhaps at one stage you displayed the number of
guesses remaining, but later decided to make the number of guesses unlimited.
You may end up with code that looks something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>guesses = 0
def make_guess():
    guess = get_input()
    global guesses
    guesses += 1
    return guess
</pre>


<p>Originally your <code>get_input</code> looked something like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>total_guesses = 20
def get_input():
    remaining = total_guesses - guesses
    return input('You have {} guesses remaining:'.format(remaining))
</pre>


<p>But since you decided to give unlimited guesses you got rid of that and it is
now simply:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>def get_input():
    return input("Please input a guess:")
</pre>


<h4>Detection</h4>
<p>Slightly more tricky this one since the variable <code>guesses</code> <strong>is</strong> inspected,
it is inspected in the update <code>guesses += 1</code>. Still you could make ask that your
automated tool ignore such uses and, in this case, still report the variable as
being defined but not used (perhaps Vulture allows this, I don't know).</p>
<p>However, it is not hard to come up with similar examples in which some value is
maintained but never actually used. For example we might have written something
like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>if total_guesses - guesses &gt; 0:
    guesses += 1
</pre>


<p>Which would likely fool most automated analyses.</p>
<p>Of course I've called this category "Counters", but it refers to maintaining any
kind of state that you don't utlimately make use of. You may have originally kept
a list/set of guesses made so far so as to prevent someone making the same guess
more than once. If you later decided against this you might forget to remove
the code which updates the set of guesses that have been made.</p>
<h3>Unused Web Application Routes</h3>
<p>You may have a route in your web application which is never linked to by any
part of the rest of your application.
Using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask/0.12">Flask</a>, for this example:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>@route('/misc/contact', methods=['GET'])
def contact_page():
    """Display a contact us page"""
    return flask.render_template('contact.jinja')
</pre>


<p>Now, if, in the rest of your application, you never link to this page, then the
page is not likely to be discovered by a user. You may even have a different
contact page, perhaps called "support" or "feedback". Perhaps this new contact
page was built to replace the older one which it has done, but you left the code for
the old route available.</p>
<h4>Detection</h4>
<p>This is tricky. First of all, you may perfectly well have a page which is not
linked to within the remainder of your application but you do want to have
available. For example you may have a route (or routes) for an API used by your
associated mobile application. </p>
<p>If you have some tests you can use coverage analysis, but if you are doing that
you likely originally had some test which covered this page, even if that unit
test only visited the page and checked that it contained some content, for example
you may have had:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span>def test_contact_page(self):
    rv = self.app.get('/misc/contact')
    assert b'id="contact-form"' in rv.data
</pre>


<p>If this test still runs, then your dead route will still be covered by your tests.
Checking whether or not the method is ever referenced directly will not work because
either such a test will not pick up the unused method because it is used within
the <code>@route</code> decorator call, or such a test would ignore that but then flag <em>all</em>
your routes as unused.</p>
<p>The only relatively robust way would be to check for calls to
<code>flask.url_for("test_contact_page")</code>. Such a check would have to look in templates
as well. It may <em>still</em> fail because such a call might never actually be invoked.
So the test would have to check the coverage analysis as well.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I take it for granted that checking for (and removing) dead code is a useful
activity that improves your code quality and removes some of your technical debt
burden. In other words, I take it for granted that dead code represents a form
of technical debt. With that in mind it seems useful to deploy any automated
analyses which can do part of the job for you. However, any code analysis
tool (whether static or dynamic) that cannot detect <strong>all</strong> (of a class of)
problems, has the disadvantage that it will tend to foster a false sense of completeness.</p>
<p>The hope is that doing the automatable part automatically frees the developer up
to do the non-automatable parts. In practice I've found that there is a tendency
to move the goal-posts from "remove all dead-code" to "remove all dead-code that
the automated analysis complains about". More generally from "maintain code free
from problem X" to "maintain code such that the automated tools do not complain about
problem X".</p>
<p>I'm certainly not arguing not to use such automated analyses. However I don't have
a solution for the problem of this implicit and accidental moving (or rather widening)
of the goal posts.</p>
