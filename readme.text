To post to the blog you probably want to do:

$ source new_post.sh "title" "comma, separated, tags"

Then write your post in the resulting posts/title.md.
You can check out how it looks with:

$ source auto.sh

Which will continually rebuild every time you save a file.

When you're ready to post, you probably want to do:

$ git add /posts/title.md
$ git commit -m "Added a new post"
$ git push origin source
$ nikola github_deploy
