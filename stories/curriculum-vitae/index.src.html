    <ul>
      <li>Developed a new programming language and an associated compiler with
          features to aid in the correction of programming errors.
          </li>
      <li>High-level problem solving research experience, dependent on the
          development of software for other users with complex requirements.
          </li>
      <li>Developed several individual and team based software projects related
          to formal analysis of models written in a process algebra which were
          used by researchers from across the globe.
          </li>
      <li>Ability to understand and improve existing software projects.
          </li>
      <li>An award-winning teacher with a diverse publication record of over 30
          articles; a proven track record of understanding and communicating
          complex concepts and ideas.
          </li>
      <li>My goal is to gain further experience outwith the academic realm in
          which I have already established my career. My passion is for building
          high quality, intuitive, and robust software; and I wish to join a
          team that builds software for large and diverse user pool.

    </ul>
    <div class="sub-heading">FORMAL ANALYSIS, 13 YEARS</div>
    Including language semantics, performance/stochastic modelling.
    <div class="sub-heading">SOFTWARE TESTING, 8 YEARS</div>
    Including coverage analysis and browser automation for full integration testing of a web service.
    <div class="sub-heading">SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KNOWLEDGE</div>
    A strong knowledge of software development related concepts. Successfully
    taught at undergraduate and masters levels, topics related to software
    engineering, agile development and development tools, people and groups,
    software measurement, and software maintenance.
    <div class="sub-heading">VARIED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE</div>
    PhD research saw the creation of a new programming language, Nitro, and
    development of a Nitro compiler. Worked in a variety of languages,
    including both statically and dynamically typed languages, imperative,
    object-oriented and functional languages, low-level systems and high-level
    application programming languages.
    <div class="sub-heading">SELF-DIRECTION</div>
    Large amount of autonomy in pursuit of promising areas of research as a
    post-doctoral researcher within a small team. Taught an important 3rd year
    course, the Software Engineering Large Practical which I completely
    redesigned.
    <div class="sub-heading">COMMUNICATION OF COMPLEX CONCEPTS</div>
    Received a EUSA teaching award certifying excellence in communicating
    feedback &mdash; a University wide recognition of ability as a communicator.
    Communication of technical and complex concepts refined in the role of a
    lecturer and tutor to Informatics students.
    <div class="sub-heading">AFFECTING ORGANISATION ADVANCEMENT</div>
    As a Feedback Officer for the School of Informatics improved the quality of
    feedback given to the students from every course in Informatics. The School
    has since increased scores for feedback in both internal and external
    student satisfaction surveys.
    <div class="sub-heading">WRITTEN COMMUNICATION</div>
    Publications record demonstrates international recognition of quality
    technical written communication as well as
    innovative research.
