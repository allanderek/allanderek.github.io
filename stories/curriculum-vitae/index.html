    <ul>
<li>Developed a new programming language and an associated compiler with
          features to aid in the correction of programming errors.
          <a class="reveal-more-link">more ...</a>
          <div class="more-information">
            <p>
            During my PhD I developed a new programming language named Nitro.
            The purpose of Nitro was to bridge the gap between applications
            programming languages and the system programming languages that are
            used to provide the runtime services, such as automatic memory
            management, for these application languages. To do this Nitro allows
            the user to not only specify types but how those types are represented
            in memory. Because such memory representations are formally specified
            the type-checker can then ensure that they are used correctly.
            As part of my PhD I developed the language, specified in formally in
            structural operational semantics, proved some useful properties that
            the language has, developed a stable compiler for the Nitro language,
            and used it to write some software such as a text editor which used
            the NCurses library directly without any need to marshal the native
            NCurses data types into a Nitro data type.

          development of software for other users with complex requirements.

            <p>I was involved in the <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa">PEPA research group.</a>
               PEPA is a language for expressing mathematical models of systems, which is used to
               investigate properties of many different kinds of systems from server-client systems,
               distributed systems, epidemiology processes, and the modelling of crowds. Bio-PEPA is
               a varient of PEPA particularly suitable for systems biology modelling. Users typically
               create a model of the system under investigation and then ask performance related queries
               such as: <i>What is the average number of waiting customers?</i> or <i>What is the
               probability that a request has been served within a given time constraint?</i>
            </p>
            <p>My work was mostly involved in the development of solution techniques and the development
               of software to realise those solution techniques. In addition I worked on the difficult problem
               of designing a sound and useful language for the user to specify their query. I also
               worked on extensions to the modelling languages themselves and techniques to analyse models for
               modelling errors, in a similar way that static code analysis analyses software code for possible
               programming errors.

                  <li>I joined the development teams on both Eclipse plug-ins for
                      the PEPA and Bio-PEPA languages. These projects are written

            I have lectured 4<sup>th</sup> undergraduate and Masters courses, Distributed Systems and
            Software Architecture, Process, and Management. Both courses had over 120 students however
            I engaged well with the students enough to win a Teaching Award for the feedback I gave to
            students. I have also taught two 3<sup>rd</sup> year undergraduate courses the Computer Science
            Large Practical and the Software Engineering Large Practical. Both are core courses for 3<sup>rd</sup>
            year students and involve lectures as well as the setting and grading of a substantial individual
            practical. In addition, I have tutored 1<sup>st</sup> year students learning to program in Haskell
            and Java. I have also supervised several students through their Masters or 4<sup>th</sup> year
            undergraduate projects, guiding many to first class awards.
         </p>
         <p>
            After my teaching award I was appointed as the feedback officer for the school of Informatics
            with the remit of improving the school's scores for feedback on student surveys, a remit that was
            achieved every year for which I was the school's feedback officer.
         </p>
         <p>
            I was also tasked with the role of personal tutor for approximately 20 students each year. This role,
            is mostly a pastoral role guiding students through their studies but does involve exercising judgement
            in suggesting study directions/courses for students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside this I continued research as part of the PEPA group and in particular made contributions
            towards the QUANTICOL project including data collection, analysis and modelling of the City of Edinburgh's
            bus services. Developing almost exclusively in Python.
