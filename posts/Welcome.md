# Welcome to Coding Diet

This is a simple blog intended to be related to good software development
practices, but will probably contain more practical examples that I come across
as I code. I use mainly Python for programming but, since a proportion of the
coding I do is for web development I end up writing CoffeeScript or vanilla
Javascript as well. I'm not averse to other languages as well and have a fairly
strong background in Haskell which I may occasionally refer to as an example.
